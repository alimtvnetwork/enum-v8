# Cycle 12 — `01-app/14-tests-folder-walkthrough.md` Code-vs-Spec Audit

> Audited 2026-05-05. Spec catalogues `tests/integratedtests/` layout, `tests/testwrappers/` packages, and `coretests.GetAssert` helper inventory — **none of which `enum-v7` consumes**. Mirrors the §13 finding from cycle 11. Also exposed that cycle 11's "01-app/ is clean" claim was premature — 7 more `integratedtests` hits remained across `01-package-map.md`, `02-design-philosophy.md`, and `14-…` itself.

## Method
Read end-to-end, extracted every checkable claim, then verified each against `enum-v7/tests/creationtests/` and against referenced spec sub-paths.

## Findings opened & closed in this cycle

### D-CVS-39 — `tests/integratedtests/` per-package layout in §14 (7th occurrence)
- §1 prescribed `tests/integratedtests/` as the canonical layout with 16+ subfolder examples — folder doesn't exist; correct upstream path is `tests/creationtests/`.
- Fix: §1 retitled "**`tests/creationtests/` *(upstream)* — One Folder per Source Package**"; scope warning added pointing `enum-v7` readers at §13's §6.1; tree diagram updated; cross-link to all six prior occurrences (C-CVS-01 / D-CVS-17 / D-CVS-26 / D-CVS-27 / D-CVS-32 / D-CVS-36).

### D-CVS-40 — `tests/integratedtests/widgettests/` walkthrough example (8th occurrence)
- §5 line 175 worked-example folder path corrected to `tests/creationtests/widgettests/` with an inline `enum-v7`-specific redirect ("register the enum in `tests/creationtests/allBasicEnumsCollection.go` instead").

### D-CVS-41 — GetAssert observation source path (9th occurrence)
- §3 stability note rewritten to cite upstream `tests/creationtests/GetAssert_*_test.go`.

### D-CVS-42 — Spec lacks consumer-coverage callout (NEW, mirrors D-CVS-38)
- Same pattern as cycle 11's D-CVS-38: every wrapper, helper, and layout described is upstream-only for `enum-v7`. Added explicit callout naming `tests/testwrappers/`, `coretests.GetAssert`, `coretestcases.CaseV1`, `StringsTestWrapper` and pointing `enum-v7` readers at §13 §6.1.

### Collateral fixes — `01-package-map.md` §8 + `02-design-philosophy.md` line 183
- Cycle 11 declared `spec/01-app/` clean of `integratedtests` references after fixing D-CVS-36, but a re-sweep this cycle found 7 more hits (5 in `01-package-map.md` §8, 1 in `02-design-philosophy.md` line 183, 1 latent in `14-…` outside §1). All fixed in this cycle as in-scope collateral. Sweep now genuinely clean: `rg -n 'tests/integratedtests' spec/01-app/` returns only **intentional anti-pattern callouts** in `05-enum-system.md` line 417 (a "do NOT do this" entry that must keep the wrong path) and the new D-CVS-39/D-CVS-42 references in `13-…` and `14-…` themselves.

### Cycle 11 correction (no new finding)
- Cycle 11's scoreboard claim "Cross-spec sweep status: `rg -n 'tests/integratedtests' spec/01-app/` is now clean" was incomplete — `01-package-map.md` and `02-design-philosophy.md` were missed. Corrected in this cycle. The next AH-style sweep should look at `02-design-philosophy.md`, `01-package-map.md`, and any later `01-app/` files BEFORE auditing them, not after.

## Verifiable subset score

**Cycle 86 AB residual:** 100.0 % (24 / 24 verifiable). 0 ❓ remain.

## Cycle 86 new findings

### D-CVS-64 — CRITICAL REGRESSION: prior `integratedtests` "fixes" inverted the upstream truth
- Cycles 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 (C-CVS-01, D-CVS-17/26/27/32/36/39/40/41) treated `tests/integratedtests/` as a stale path and rewrote spec text to `tests/creationtests/`. Cycle 86 AB-clone of `core-v9 v1.5.8` shows the OPPOSITE: upstream has `tests/integratedtests/` with **92 subfolders** AND `tests/creationtests/` is one of those 92 subfolders. The path `tests/integratedtests/argstests/` is real. `enum-v5` happens to use `tests/creationtests/` at the top level for its enum-creation suite — that is the local convention only.
- **Spec impact:** every "fixed" spec sentence that now reads `tests/creationtests/` for upstream context is now wrong in the opposite direction.
- **Fix required (AJ-NEW HIGH):** rewrite §1, §3, §5 of `14-tests-folder-walkthrough.md`, §8 of `01-package-map.md`, line 183 of `02-design-philosophy.md` to: (a) keep `tests/integratedtests/` as the upstream canonical path; (b) add `enum-v5`-specific redirect "→ in this consumer, the enum-creation cases live under `tests/creationtests/` instead". Do NOT delete the upstream path.

### D-CVS-65 — LOW: filename typo `TextValidatorsWrapper.go`
- Spec §2.4 lists `TextValidatorWrapper.go` (singular). Actual file is `TextValidatorsWrapper.go` (plural). Update spec line.

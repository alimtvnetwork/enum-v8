# Project Memory

## Core
This is a Go enum library (**enum-v8**, module path `github.com/alimtvnetwork/enum-v8` — renamed from `enum-v6`, previously `enum-v5`, `enum-v4`, `enum-v3`, `enum-v2`, originally `enum-v1`). The frontend React/Vite shell is incidental — work happens in Go packages and PowerShell/Python tooling.
Core dependency import path is `github.com/alimtvnetwork/core-v9` (was renamed from `core-v8`). All source imports use `core-v9` — never reintroduce `core-v8` outside `cross-repo/core-v9/`.
**`go.mod` bridge RESOLVED:** upstream `core-v9` now declares `module github.com/alimtvnetwork/core-v9` (tag `v1.5.8`). The `replace` directive has been removed. `go.mod` pins `require core-v9 v1.5.8` cleanly.
**API migration patched:** `core-v9` refactored converters to struct namespaces (`AnyTo`, `StringTo`); obsolete `TypeName`/package-level converter calls were rewritten. Await local `./run.ps1 -tc` validation.
The `cross-repo/core-v9/` directory mirrors CI surface to a separate upstream repo and intentionally keeps its `core-v8` name. Do not rename it. As of 2026-05-06, `enum-v3` → `enum-v8` rename WAS applied inside `cross-repo/` per user direction (one-time exception to the usual leave-cross-repo-alone rule).
**Tests live under `tests/creationtests/`, NOT `tests/integratedtests/`.** Tooling that probes test packages must accept either name (or read from disk) — never hard-code one. Spec docs that still say `integratedtests` are stale (see audit finding C-CVS-01).
**NEVER send emails or configure email-based notifications** (Dependabot recipients, SMTP, CI email alerts). User rejects all email flows.
User workflow: incremental "next" commands, expects the remaining-task list shown after every step.
**Any code changes must bump at least minor version everywhere except `.release/` folder — never modify `.release/`.**
**Suggestions go in `.lovable/suggestions.md` — single file, update in-place.**
**Pending issues go in `.lovable/pending-issues/` — one file per issue.**
**Plan lives at `.lovable/plan.md` — single file with phases, task letters, and next-task selection.**
